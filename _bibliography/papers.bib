abstract = {Transfer learning can address the issue of insufficient labels in machine learning. Using knowledge in a labeled domain (source domain) can assist in acquiring and learning knowledge in a domain (target domain) that lacks some or all labels. In this paper, we propose a new cluster-based semi-supervised transfer learning (CBSSTL) under a new assumption that samples in the target domain are unlabeled but contain cluster information. Furthermore, we propose a new transfer learning framework and a method for fine-tuning parameters. We tested and compared the proposed method with other unsupervised and semi-supervised transfer learning methods on well-known image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, we created a localization dataset for transfer learning. Finally, we tested and analyzed the proposed method on this dataset. Its particularly challenging nature makes it difficult for our method to work effectively.}
